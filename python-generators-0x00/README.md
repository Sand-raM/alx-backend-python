# Python Generators - Project 0x00

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python generators, which enable efficient handling of large datasets by generating items one at a time. Generators reduce memory consumption and improve performance for data processing tasks.

## Key Features
- **Custom Generators**: Create functions that yield results on-the-fly.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Replace traditional lists with generators for scalable solutions.
- **Use Cases**:
  - File reading line by line.
  - Lazy evaluation for large computations.
  - Infinite sequences.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
